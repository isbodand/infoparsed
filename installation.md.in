# Installation

If you wish to use InfoParse, logically, you need to acquire a copy of it.
This is achievable in some ways, two of which are presented here.

## conan

NOTE: The last released version is `1.5.2`. The advised way is now to use [InfoCDepend](#InfoCDepend).

InfoParse uses [conan](htpps://conan.io) as its dependency manager a packager.
That means, we at InfoSoft gradually provide new InfoParse releases on our
conan server, the latest of which is always recommended to be used.
Our server is available at `conan.isdevnet.com` upon which InfoParse is
published as `InfoParse/${InfoParse_VERSION}@bodand/stable`.

More in-depth documentation on using conan to get InfoParse follows for
those not familiar with custom servers or with conan in general.
\[Note: We assume you already have a working copy of conan installed.
To get conan look at their [website](htpps://conan.io) for documentation.]

### Remote

InfoSoft's conan package repository is `conan.isdevnet.com`.
To tell conan to search in this repository in addition to `conan-central`
one needs to add it as a remote:

```shell
$ conan remote add InfoSoft-Conan-Server https://conan.isdevnet.com
```

\[Note: The `InfoSoft-Conan-Server` is the server's local name thus it
can be any arbitrary locally unique string.]

To see if it worked you can preform a listing on the current remotes
and search for InfoParse and even list all packages on our server.

```shell
$ conan remote list
$ conan search InfoParse
$ conan search -r InfoSoft-Conan-Server
```

### Requirement

If you searched for InfoParse in the last paragraph you saw what is
the name you need to add as a requirement.

Add `InfoParse/${InfoParse_VERSION}@bodand/stable` to your conanfile.(py|txt) and conan
shall automagically install the package for you by running

```shell
$ conan install . -if <your_build_dir> -b missing
```

## InfoCDepend

InfoSoft's in-house project dependency installer CMake script is available at
`https://github.com/isbodand/InfoCDepend`

Using InfoCDepend you can locally install project dependencies for your projects:

### Get InfoCDepend

The first step is to install the InfoCDepend script. Currently it does not,
although future versions will update themselves so only one installation will
be necessary.

```cmake
# InfoCDepend
set(CDepend_FILE "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake/InfoCDepend.cmake")

file(DOWNLOAD
        https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isbodand/InfoCDepend/master/InfoCDepend.cmake
        "${CDepend_FILE}"
        )

include("${CDepend_FILE}")
```

Make sure the path you are downloading to exists.

### GetDependency

After installing you local InfoCDepend script and included it, you can use it to
get dependencies:

```cmake
# InfoParse
GetDependency(InfoParse https://github.com/isbodand/infoparse.git)

# other dependencies

include_directories(libs/include)
```

And that is it. You now have InfoParse installed locally. With tremendous additional
logging information no-one asked for.

## Build it

You can build and install it on your local machine as described in the
[appropriate documentation](/infoparsed/build).
